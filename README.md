# ChainLang
Contains source codes for the ChainC and ChainVM, a crucial part of the ChainLang DevKit, the development kit for the Chain Programing Language.


## Progress
As of beta 0.3.1, the ChainLang Project has fixed major bugs in the code, and the ChainC (Chain Compiler) module is almost ready for the ver.1 release. We also added virtual machine directives marked by the '@' sign, which allows for future use such as allowing memory tracing and debugging.


## Future APIs and Features
The Chain DevKit is to include the Education Module, starting with '@trace'. Moreover, we also plan to allow to chain binary (.exec) or chain executable.
